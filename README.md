All Pages on the website have:

         The user must fill in the First 5 input fields in order to submit otherwise a pop up message appears stating  **Please fill out this form**.  
            The user submits the form using the submit button which is titled **Sign up now**. 
- Thank You Page.
   - A brief thanks message to the user letting them know their form has successfully been submitted.

## Skeleton
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Please note the actual website has changed Since these wireframes.
During the building process I decided to Change the home page and added an image as the background as I felt it stood out more as I had not much content on the home page as I did not want it cluttered. I also added a button to link to the about page if the user wanted to find out more.
I also decided to change my about page slightly and added my image opposite the text as I felt it looked better this way.

## Flowchart

I created the following flowchart during the planning process as a basic guideline to follow when coding my project.
